# Pandas-Web-scrapping
Web-scrapping with Pandas

This is a very easy to use Pandas for web-scrapping BUT it works only with HTML tables! We can extract a list of all the table elements found at a given URL (table headers, table data, table rows).
This shortcut is a single command that skips the entire process of accessing the Developer Tools and finding specific elements on the page!
